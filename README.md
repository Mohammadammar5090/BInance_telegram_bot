It is a Telegram trading bot

I have developed a Telegram bot that fetches information from your Binance account and performs the following functions:

1. Market buy and sell orders.
2. Limit buy and sell orders.
3. OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other) orders.
4. Sends updates on the price of a specified cryptocurrency.
5. Allows for simple analysis operations.
6. Notifies the bot user of the financial volume invested in selected cryptocurrencies by the user.
7. Generates a CSV file at the end of each day, containing all executed transactions, total profit and loss, and specific details for each currency. This file is sent through the bot.
8. Currently, I am working on implementing price prediction using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) and other prediction methods.

Regarding point number 6, it is the most significant feature of this bot, as it allows you to anticipate market upswings in the price of a cryptocurrency before they occur. This enables users to buy or sell and achieve financial gains based on market movements and currency performance.
